# Welcome to Professor Snape's Potion Challenge! 
#### In this application, the goal is for a user to be able to register a username and password, select a Hogwarts House, and have their personal game scores contribute to the House Cup. 
#### The user will be able to login to their account and pick up where they left off. 
#
#### The user will be challenged to select the correct potion ingredients in a set amount of time, and also with a limited number of guesses for each potion, using the ingredients in their inventory. The game will end if the user either runs out of time before each potion is completed, if they make too many incorrect guesses, or if they run out of ingredients. 
#
#### The user wins the game by completing the set of potion challenges within the alotted time frame. Successful potions will generate points, which will then be added to the House Cup score. The House with the most points will be displayed in first place. The goal of the user is to complete the potion challenge as quickly and accurately as possible in order to collect the maximum number of points for each round.
